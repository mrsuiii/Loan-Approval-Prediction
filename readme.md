# Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the **Loan Approval Prediction** problem from the Kaggle competition: **Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10**. The notebook includes a complete workflow, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on the features provided in the dataset. The task is a **binary classification problem**, where the target variable `LoanApproval` is either `1` (approved) or `0` (rejected).

## Whatâ€™s Included

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding the data distribution.
   - Identifying missing values and outliers.
   - Visualizing key relationships and trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling numerical features.


3. **Model Training:**
   - Training multiple machine learning models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and use ensemble method (Meta model).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
